# RPC-based-communication-implementation


Instructions to compile

To compile in cmd: 

1.	Open the directory/folder where the project resided.

2.	Run the server and client files in separate cmd terminal.

3.	First run the server file and then run the client file.

4.	Run the program as: python filename.py. Eg: python fileClient.py

5.	Choose the menu options in the client side.

Issues:

1.	Encoding and Decoding of data over the communication between the client and server was hard to implement.

2.	In the RPC implementation the packing and unpacking of parameters at the client and server side respectively was hard to implement as it required generating regex to split the parameters as per syntax.
